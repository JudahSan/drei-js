## Notes

* **Scene Setup:** Creating a basic scene with an icosahedron (20-sided Platonic solid) mesh as the central object.
* **Camera and Controls:** It uses a perspective camera with `OrbitControls` for user interaction to navigate around the scene.
* **Materials:** The mesh uses a `MeshStandardMaterial` with a blue color and flat shading. An additional wireframe mesh is added for a subtle outline effect.
* **Lighting:** A `HemisphereLight` provides ambient lighting to the scene.
* **Animation:** The `animate` function continuously updates the scene. Currently, it only rotates the mesh on the Y-axis.
* **Spline:** Representation of a line in 3D space
